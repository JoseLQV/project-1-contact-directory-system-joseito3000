project-1-contact-directory-system-joseito3000 created by GitHub Classroom   (fork from my university account to my personal account)

This Data Structure course project:

In this project I was given input files that contained the information of each user, from username, ids, emails, numbers, frineds.
Analyzed the files and learned to use Object-Oriented Programming to seperate and distribute the information from each user.
Implemented ArrayList, SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedLists throughout the project.
